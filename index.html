    <h3>About:</h3>
    <p>This website is meant to help those who either are struggling a bit in subjects or want to know what their final grade will be. <br> As a student myself, I know that it's difficult to keep up with school work, especially if you don't understand it. Hopefully this website will help you find resources to help you achieve mastery in a subject.</p>
